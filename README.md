The bit where we do frontend

I'm starting out with the displayProducts function, but have to take a natural break here. I also realised at this point that I forgot to include prices for my "products" in the last part of the assignment ><. I've dropped a message to Christoffer asking how to best amend the situation.

Finished function to display products in cart. I might have to work on the designpart when it comes to the display on the shopping basket, but I'll save that for later.

I've started with the frontend JavaScript. So far I've managed access the products from the database and displayed them in the console. Next step is to display them in the html.

I got the server to connect to my HTML and CSS, so it runs on my localhost. I've started creating values on my main.js, and the next step would be to create get and display functions.

I've run my code through a validator, so the HTML is set to go. Next step is to write some mockup JS-code.

Tuesday, 20:00
-
Design for both pages done. I've done some simpler bug testing, but the media queries seem to work just fine. Before starting otu I should run the html through a validator.

Tuesday, 18:00
-
Design done with media queries on landing page. Now I need to design a shopping cart, either as an overlay or as a separate page.

Some small changes here and there. This is mostly backup.

Monday, 18:48
-
Started working on media queries. The header is as good as done, and the next step will be to fix the flex on main. Footer will also need touching up. 

But that's for tomorrow!

I switched up my design a bit. I'm as good as done with the header and footer, now I'll get on with the rikishi cards.

Monday, around lunch
-
So far I'm in the beginning stages of html and css. I'm noticing that I keep going back to the same design as I had during the last examination of the first course. While this isn't a pure design task, I should think about switching it up a bit.
