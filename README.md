Design done with media queries on landing page. Now I need to design a shopping cart, either as an overlay or as a separate page.

Some small changes here and there. This is mostly backup.

Started working on media queries. The header is as good as done, and the next step will be to fix the flex on main. Footer will also need touching up. 

But that's for tomorrow!

I switched up my design a bit. I'm as good as done with the header and footer, now I'll get on with the rikishi cards.

So far I'm in the beginning stages of html and css. I'm noticing that I keep going back to the same design as I had during the last examination of the first course. While this isn't a pure design task, I should think about switching it up a bit.
